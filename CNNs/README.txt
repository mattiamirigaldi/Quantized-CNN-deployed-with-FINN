Exercise 0: training and test loop tutorial
Exercise 1: training loop optimization for a 2-layer network.
Exercise 2: design of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit classification
Exercise 2bis: design of a CNN for fashion MNIST
Exercise 3: design of a CNN for image classification on CIFAR10, learn to reduce over-fitting and vanishing gradients
Exercise 4: quantization of previous CNN models with fake-quantize methods, port to brevitas and export to FINN
Exercise 5: FINN tutorials, deployment of a small CNN to a custom accelerator generated with FINN

In the report is included:
 - For exercise 1 through 4 the code of CNN models used during the experiments, plus training hyper-parameters, pre- and
   post-processing of data, special constructs/classes/functions used outside or within the CNN model during the training process
 - For exercise 5 only, included the code of the jupyter notebooks was modified in order to port model from FINN onto the ZCU104 development board. 
   Also the table with all the HW metrics extraced  from FINN.
